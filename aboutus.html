                        After
                        seeing my
                        co-workers struggle in the pandemic with technology, I decided to change my career to make
                        simple,
                        useful and user friendly apps and websites. I would like to become a full stack developer with
                        experience in Advanced Server-Side and Client-Side JavaScript, Advanced HTML, CSS and React and
                        component frameworks.
